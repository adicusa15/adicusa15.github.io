        The Benefits of Meditation
    </h2>
<p style="text-align:left">
  &nbsp&nbsp Meditation is considered a type
  of complementary medicine that
  engages the body and mind. During
  this practice of relaxation, the focus
  is concentrated in one direction, so
  as to eliminate from the mental
  level the chaotic and overwhelming thoughts,
  responsible for the state of general tension
  and anxiety. The process leads to higher
  physiological and emotional well-being.
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp The main benefit of meditation is
  that it offers you a state of calm,
   peace and balance, essential for an
   “iron health”. The beneficial effects
   of meditation do not end at the end of
   the relaxation session but continue to
   have a positive impact on the body and brain
   for a long time afterwards.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp At the level of emotional well-being,
meditation brings the following benefits: gaining a
new perspective on stressful situations; development
of personal stress management skills; increasing
self-awareness; focus on the present time; and reducing
negative feelings. As practitioners provide training on a
large number of meditation techniques passed down from generation
to generation. It is important to know the instrument of this
practice of internal balancing, namely the conscious relaxation
of the body and the concentration of thoughts on a single direction,
for a certain period of time. This exercise will distract you from
the problems caused by stress. Thus, the body receives a period
of relaxation and regeneration, by reducing the level
of stress hormones. Here's what you can do, specifically,
during an effective meditation session:<pre>1. Sit comfortably in a quiet room.
2. Close your eyes.
3. Start by relaxing the muscles of the legs, continuing with the entire
<a href="better workouts.html"><i>body musculature</i></a>, up to the top of
the head (the technique is called progressive muscle relaxation).
3. Focus on breathing.
4. Inhale deeply and release your mind from thoughts. Count the number of times
you breathe, pronouncing the number each time you exhale (this way, occupy your
mind with information and avoid distracting your attention).
5. Continue to do this for 10-20 minutes.</pre>
