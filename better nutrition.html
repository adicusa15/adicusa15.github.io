        The Value of Healthy Eating Habits
    </h2>
<p style="text-align:left">
The way we perceive nutrition and the choices we make
every day has a significant impact on our health and well-being.
To be able to see visible effects, people need to understand that
proper and healthy eating should not be occasional but have to be
integrated into oneâ€™s lifestyle that will ensure overall health and
longevity.
<br>
No food alone can bring all the nutritional principles that the
body needs, but only a varied, moderate and balanced diet.
According to recent studies there are several rules for healthy
eating and a balanced lifestyle:<i>1. Choose seasonal and local foods.</i>
This urge is not just for those concerned about the ozone layer and
the carbon footprint left over by food production and transportation.
By buying local produce you make sure they are fresh, and if you buy
seasonal produce you will be assured of a more varied diet.
The easiest way to reconcile both goals is to buy from local
producers, usually from rural areas. You can find seasonal products
in the big supermarket chains, but they are often brought from other
areas. Seasonal food has the highest nutrient load, so it is the best
choice. <i>2.	Have breakfast every day.</i> At the beginning of a day,
after a night of fasting, in which our body has continued to function,
and consumed energy, it is an absolutely natural and necessary gesture
to feed ourselves. Thus, ensuring a greater chance of staying healthy
and prevent a number of health conditions. There has been recorded an
increased number of cardiovascular problems in people who are not used
to eat breakfast. By starting to eat at the early hours of the day, we
can better adjust the pace of meals and the quantities of food we will
eat throughout the day. Those who do not get used to have breakfast and
practice <a href="better workouts.html"><i>physical activities</i></a> are
at higher risk of gaining weight. In the history of most people with obesity
there is a lack of breakfast for years. Although some people are used to start
their day with only coffee, it is ideal to enjoy it after breakfast. A cup of
coffee stimulates metabolism and causes more intense mental activity throughout
the day. <i>3. Consume nutrient-dense foods.</i> The basis of our diet should
consist of foods of plant origin. Vegetables are truly healthy food. Fruits,
too, should be regarded as a supplement to nutrition, especially when there
are problems with body weight.  The minimum amount of vegetables and fruits
we should consume daily to maintain our health is 5 servings (one serving is
considered to be around 80 grams). In the food category of animal origin, we
should not miss dairy, valuable source of good quality protein, calcium and
other micronutrients, eggs, fish and, to a lesser extent, and meat.
